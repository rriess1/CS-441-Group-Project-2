Help WeatherCat navigate the weather! WeatherCat is a stray cat in the streets of Binghamton. This uses openweatherAPI to get the current weather in Binghamton. Then, the background and projectiles change based on the current weather. Help WeatherCat get across the screen without getting hit! Don't let WeatherCat down!
